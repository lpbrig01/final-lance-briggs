# About Me

My name is Lance Briggs, and I’m an IT major. This website is my final project for a web development class.

I’m interested in tech, especially web development and cybersecurity. Projects like this help me get better with Git, GitHub, Hugo, and hosting websites on Netlify.

Outside of school I run track, lift, and like working on small coding projects when I get time. This site is a mix of school work and things I’m learning as I go.
