# About Me

My name is Lance Briggs. I’m an IT major and this website is part of a class assignment.

The main goal of this project is to:

- Get comfortable using Hugo
- Put my homework write-ups somewhere public
- Practice using GitHub and Netlify

Outside of class I run track and like working on small tech projects.
