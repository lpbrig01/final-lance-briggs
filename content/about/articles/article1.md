title: "Article 1: Balancing Track and Tech"
---

In this article I talk about how I balance being a student-athlete with learning tech and doing school projects like this website.

Most days I’m juggling classes, practice, lifting, homework, and trying to still have downtime. It's not perfect, but having both track and tech in my life motivates me and keeps me moving forward.

The main point is that balancing these responsibilities teaches me discipline and time management, which carry over into my academic and professional work.
