title: "Article 3: My Website Enhancement"

For my enhancement, I customized parts of the Ananke theme. I changed the colors, spacing, and some of the visual style so the site felt more like something I designed and not just the default theme.

I explored the theme files, figured out where styles were coming from, and overrode them in my own stylesheet. It took trial and error, but it helped me understand how Hugo themes are structured.

This enhancement wasn't huge visually, but it taught me a lot about customizing themes and making a static site feel more personal.
