# Blog

Welcome to my blog for the final project.  
I used this space to write about what I learned while building the website, along with a few quick posts to meet the assignment requirements.

Two of the posts are more detailed “substantive” pieces where I actually reflect on the process. The others are short filler posts to show that I understand how Hugo handles categories, dates, and sections.
