# Welcome

This site is my final project for my web development class.

I built it using Hugo and the Ananke theme, and I’m hosting it on Netlify. Everything here is meant to show that I can structure a full website, write consistent pages, and explain the work I did.

On this site you’ll find:

- A short About page  
- Four Articles  
- A Blog with several posts  

Each section is part of the requirements for this assignment.
